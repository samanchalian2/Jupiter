# Current State

**Phase:** GOAL-003 complete; GOAL-004 is ready.

GOAL-001 through GOAL-003 are complete. The repository contains the executable
foundation plus a PostgreSQL migration for organizations, users, memberships,
roles/permissions, organization directory tables, audit logs, and RLS policies.
Local authentication supports bootstrap platform administration and login.

Validation on 2026-08-09: PostgreSQL 18.4 is installed locally and Jupiter is
running at 127.0.0.1:5433. Migration 001_identity.sql applied successfully;
RLS returned one department for each of two tenant contexts and zero for an
unknown context. The local database password exists only in ignored .env.
